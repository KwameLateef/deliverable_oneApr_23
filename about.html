      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p>Greatings and welcome to my page! My name <strong>Kwame Hampton</strong>, and I am extremely excited about attending Grand Circus Front-End Bootcamp. My earliest experience with coding had to the programming language BASIC- yes, I was born in the early 80s. I was in early elementary school at that time.
